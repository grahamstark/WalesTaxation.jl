"General description","The Welsh Government conducts the council tax dwellings survey (CT1 form). Data are available on the number of dwellings eligible for the council tax in each local authority for the next financial year, analysed by council tax band, including the numbers of properties eligible for council tax discounts and exemptions.

Data cover Wales for all years since 1996-97. Data for earlier years is available for the former districts of Wales, which were re-organised on 1 April 1996.

The survey has been conducted every October to December since 1993-94. Results are available in early January, approximately three months before the beginning of the financial year.

Council tax is a charge levied on each domestic dwelling for the provision of local authority services. This includes elements for the county or county borough council, together with elements for the police authority and, if one exists, for the local community council. In 1991, the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) assessed the properties in each county or county borough area and placed each dwelling in a valuation band, ranging from A to H. Dwellings in new buildings are placed in one of the bands according to the value that such a dwelling would have been worth in 1991. 

The dwellings were revalued in 2003 and the bandings revised for the 2005-06 year onwards. The bandings for Wales based on the 1991 valuation were: A - Up to £30,000; B - £30,001 to £39,000; C - £39,001 to £51,000; D - £51,001 to £66,000; E - £66,001 to £90,000; F - £90,001 to £120,000; G - £120,001 to £240,000; H - £240,001 and above. The bandings for Wales based on the 2003 valuation are: A - under £44,000; B - £44,001 to £65,000; C - £65,001 to £91,000; D - £91,001 to £123,000; E - £123,001 to £162,000; F - £162,001 to £223,000; G - £223,001 to £324,000; H - £324,001 to £424,000; I - £424,001 and above.
