"General description","Council tax is a charge levied on each domestic dwelling for the provision of local authority services. This includes elements for the county or county borough council, together with elements for the police authority and, if one exists, for the local community council. 

In 1991, the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) assessed the properties in each county or county borough area and placed each dwelling in a valuation band, ranging from A to H. Dwellings in new buildings are placed in one of the bands according to the value that such a dwelling would have been worth in 1991. The dwellings were revalued in 2003 and the bandings revised for the 2005-06 year onwards.

The bandings for Wales based on the 1991 valuation were:

A - Up to £30,000
B - £30,001 to £39,000
C - £39,001 to £51,000
D - £51,001 to £66,000
E - £66,001 to £90,000
F - £90,001 to £120,000
G - £120,001 to £240,000
H - £240,001 - No upper limit

The bandings for Wales based on the 2003 valuation are:

A - under £44,000 
B - £44,001 to £65,000 
C - £65,001 to £91,000 
D - £91,001 to £123,000 
E - £123,001 to £162,000 
F - £162,001 to £223,000 
G - £223,001 to £324,000 
H - £324,001 to £424,000 
I - £424,001 and above"
